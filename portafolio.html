        <p>
            A blog is a web page where you can publish your ideas, content and opinions of all kinds, from a
            personal point of view, different from any other.
            These publications (also known as entries, posts or articles, may also contain images,
            video, or even multimedia content extracted from other media) usually allow to organize the publications
            in taxonomies, which is any way of classifying content, such as categories or tags, to facilitate
            the visitor the reading of the contents that interest him most by theme, without having to simply read
            by chronology.
            It also enables visitors to leave comments on each publication, thus generating
            a conversation in which, based on the content raised by the blogger, the audience contributes their
            impressions, enriching the content as a whole (also giving “like” or “dislike”).
            In addition to writing, illustrate your content with photos, image galleries, maps, insert players
            audio and video, and even display content from other social media, such as Twitter tweets, photos of
            Instagram, Tik Tok videos, etc.

            One of the main functions of the APIs is to be able to facilitate the work of developers and
            save them time and money. For example, if you are creating an application that is an online store, do not
            you will need to create a payment system or another from scratch to check if there is available stock of a
            product. You can use the API of an existing payment service, for example MercadoPago, Modo,
            NaranjaX, PayPal, and ask your distributor for an API that allows you to know the stock they have.
            With this, it will not be necessary to reinvent the wheel with each service that is created, since you will
            be able to
            use parts or functions that others have already created. Imagine if each online store had to have its
            own payment system, for normal users it is much more comfortable to be able to do it with the main
            services that almost everyone uses.
            An API for e-commerce provides organized business management and has different functions:
            automate shipping and marketing of your business, have greater control over inventory and improve
            customer service.

            The first cell phones, Nokia brand, brought a game that was all the rage.
            One of the most powerful reasons that children gave for having a cell phone was that they could play with it
            Snake, the famous Nokia viper game, which had to eat to keep growing, making the
            challenge was not to collide with oneself; this ended up entertaining children and adults for hours.
            Python includes a module called "turtle" that allows you to create turtle graphs.
            Logo's "turtle" is a cursor that can be given movement commands (forward, backward, or turn) and
            which can leave a trace on the screen. Properly moving the turtle can be achieved
            draw all kinds of figures.

            REST APIs provide a flexible and lightweight way to integrate applications. They have emerged as the method
            most common for connecting components in microservice architectures.
            An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications can
            applications or devices connect and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that meets the
            design principles of the REST architecture style or representational state transfer. for this
            For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to as RESTful APIs.
            PROJECT Scenario: It has been decided to hold an Independent Cinema event. where producers and
            Local film directors will be able to present their works that will be evaluated by a jury that will choose
            the
            winners. We have been asked to develop a REST API to be able to record the information of the
            participants and works. The contest is interested in registering the works, directors, categories (defined
            by the
            contest) and actors.
            API Rest performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete Resources (Entities) operations.

        <p>
            A web page is essentially a digital business card, whether for companies, organizations, or
            people, as well as a way to communicate ideas, thoughts, knowledge, information or theories.
            This information is generally in HTML or XHTML format, and may provide access to other
            web pages through hypertext links. They often also include other resources such as
            cascading style sheets, scripts, digital images, among others.
            Web pages can be stored on a computer or on a remote web server. The web server can
            restrict access only to private networks, for example, on a corporate intranet, or you can publish
            pages on the World Wide Web. Access to the web pages is made through a transfer from
            servers, using the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP).
            Likewise, the new trend is that web pages are not only attractive to Internet users,
            but also optimized (prepared), for search engines through the source code.
