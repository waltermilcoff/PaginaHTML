      <p>
        Hello, my name is Walter, I am a software developer, an enthusiast
        of the I.T. world, if I have to describe myself, I start by noting that I am
        tenacious, determined and persevering, I have the virtue to join
        working groups, actively exercising the role assigned to me.
        Curious and constantly learning in order to acquire new
        development tools and constantly strengthen skills
        acquired. I have full confidence in my ability to design and
        implement software systems are useful, functional and
        scalable, following an agreed business scheme. I work with
        Python and Java, along with their respective frameworks (Django and Spring)
        I constantly train myself in new development technologies. if i
        good at designing and implementing web pages and applications to publish
        ideas, content and opinions of all kinds, from a point of view
        personal, unlike any other. These posts (also
        known as entries, posts or articles, can also contain
        images, video, or even multimedia content extracted from other
        media) often allow you to organize your posts into taxonomies, which
        is any way of classifying content, such as categories or
        labels, to make it easier for the visitor to read the contents
        that interest you the most by topic, without having to read simply by
        chronology. It also enables visitors to leave
        comments on each publication, thus generating a
        conversation in which, based on the content raised by the
        blogger, the audience contributes their impressions, enriching the
        content as a whole (also give "like" or "dislike"). In addition to
        write, illustrate your content with photos, image galleries,
        maps, insert audio and video players, and even display
        content from other social media, such as Twitter tweets, photos of
        Instagram, Tik Tok videos, etc.
